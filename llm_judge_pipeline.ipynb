Incident description: Tip Session repave stuck due to active containers. Container Details:\\nteam name - NSMConfidentialComputing\\nnodeID - 152076538\\ncontainerList - 1348992VIXLC, 2959320THASS, 2460743SYENG, 1098082HTCJM\\n\\n\\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\\n\\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\\nExecutor: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\\nIncidentAgent: An agent capable of querying incident descriptions, but not providing any additional troubleshooting information beyond the description itself.\\nKustoAgent: An agent that can run the kusto query\\nGeneralAssistant: An AI-powered assistant that can handle a variety of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, summarization, text editing, content enhancement, and general assistance based on a given task description.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is a fact sheet to consider:\\n\\n\\n1. Avoid asking the Kusto query agent to generate a query unless a predefined Kusto query already exists in the plan. It will always fail.\\n2. If no suitable agent can be assigned to a step, you may assign the user proxy agent as a last resort. However, this should be avoided whenever possible.\\n3. If you request information from the user, ensure your response includes sufficient context. For example, when asking the user to run a command, specify the exact command in the user query along with the expected output. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\nStep-1: Verify Team Name - next steps: [[\\'Step-2\\']]\\n1. The IcM description will have a \"Container Details\" section containing information including a team name, nodeId, containerList (list of container IDs on the the TiP session). Check if the team name includes \"ConfidentialComputing\". If it does, proceed to the next step. If it doesn\\'t, inform that the incident does not belong to the ACC queue.\\n\\n\\nStep-2: Extract Container IDs - next steps: [[\\'Step-3\\']]\\n2. Get the container ID(s) from the provided containerList field.\\n\\n\\nStep-3: Locate VM and Resource ID - next steps: [[\\'Step-4\\']]\\n3.

Convert the ARM ID into an Azure portal link.\\nUse the ARM ID from the previous step and prepend it with \"https://ms.portal.azure.com/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource\" to create the Azure portal link.\\n\\n If ARM ID is null, then return the link https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home and prompt the user to search for the VM name.\\n\\n\\nStep-5: Delete VM or Notify Owner - next steps: [[\\'FINAL_ANSWER\\']]\\n5.
