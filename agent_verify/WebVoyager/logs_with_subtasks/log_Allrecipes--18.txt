Executing task: Find a recipe for a vegetarian lasagna that has over 300 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 or higher on Allrecipes.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna'}
Reason: A search for 'vegetarian lasagna' is needed to find recipes matching the user's criteria. Results can be filtered to find one with at least 300 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 or higher.

Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["While multiple vegetarian lasagna recipes from Allrecipes were retrieved, none of them meet the constraint of having over 300 reviews. The recipe with the highest review count, 'Vegetarian Four Cheese Lasagna', has 243 reviews, which is below the required threshold. All other constraints are met by several recipes, but the constraint on review count is not satisfied. Therefore, the subtask is not solved."]

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'lasagna'}
Reason: None of the returned vegetarian lasagna recipes from the last search have over 300 reviews, with the highest being 243. Broadening the search to 'lasagna' may help surface more results, including vegetarian lasagna variants with higher review counts.

Description: This is a fabulous lasagna made with an artichoke and spinach mixture which has been cooked with vegetable broth, onions and garlic. The mixture is layered with lasagna noodles, pasta sauce, mozzarella cheese, and topped with crumbled feta.

Ingredients:
- Cooking spray
- 9 uncooked lasagna noodles
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 (14 ounce) can marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, drained and squeezed dry
- 1 (28 ounce) jar tomato pasta sauce
- 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
3. Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat on medium-high. Saute onion and garlic for 3 minutes, or until onion is tender-crisp. Stir in broth and rosemary; bring to a boil. Stir in artichoke hearts and spinach; reduce heat, cover and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce.
4. Spread 1/4 of the artichoke mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; top with 3 cooked noodles. Sprinkle 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese over noodles. Repeat layers 2 more times, ending with artichoke mixture and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle crumbled feta on top.
