Executing task: Search for a Greek salad recipe on Allrecipes that has a prep time of under 25 minutes and more than 15 reviews. Include the primary cheese used and the type of dressing recommended.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'Greek Salad'}
Reason: The user is looking for a Greek salad recipe. Searching for 'Greek Salad' on Allrecipes is the first step to retrieve a list of candidate recipes. Then I can evaluate which meet the criteria for prep time, review count, primary cheese, and dressing.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'Greek Salad'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Search for a Greek salad recipe on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['Prep time must be under 25 minutes', 'Recipe must have more than 15 reviews']}, {'task': 'Include the primary cheese used in the recipe', 'constraints': []}, {'task': 'Include the type of dressing recommended in the recipe', 'constraints': []}]
Subtasks Solved: [False, False, False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The agent has searched for Greek salad recipes on Allrecipes and retrieved a list that includes review counts and URLs. However, the prep times for these recipes have not been identified or checked against the 'under 25 minutes' constraint. Thus, we cannot confirm that any recipe meets all required constraints.", 'The steps only include a search returning a list of Greek salad recipe links and titles. There is no information provided about ingredients, specifically the primary cheese used in Greek salad (typically feta cheese).', 'The steps taken so far only show a list of Greek salad recipe titles and URLs, with no mention or extraction of the type of dressing recommended in any recipe. There is no provided information about the dressing itself.']

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14373/greek-salad-i/'}
Reason: The recipe 'Greek Salad' has more than 15 reviews. To ensure the prep time is under 25 minutes and to collect information on the primary cheese and recommended dressing, we need the detailed recipe information.
