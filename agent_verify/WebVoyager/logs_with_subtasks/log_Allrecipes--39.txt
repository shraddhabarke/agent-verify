Executing task: Locate a recipe for sushi rolls on Allrecipes with a minimum of 20 reviews. Show the Nutrition Facts and the main ingredients. Tell me how to store these rolls.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'sushi rolls'}
Reason: To find a sushi rolls recipe with at least 20 reviews on Allrecipes, I first need to search for sushi rolls recipes and review their ratings and review counts.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'sushi rolls'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Locate a recipe for sushi rolls on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['Recipe must be for sushi rolls', 'Source must be Allrecipes', 'Recipe must have a minimum of 20 reviews']}, {'task': 'Show the Nutrition Facts for the recipe', 'constraints': ['Nutrition Facts must be from the located sushi rolls recipe']}, {'task': 'Show the main ingredients of the recipe', 'constraints': ['Main ingredients must be from the located sushi rolls recipe']}, {'task': 'Tell how to store the prepared sushi rolls', 'constraints': ['Storage advice should apply to the specific sushi roll recipe found']}]
Subtasks Solved: [True, False, False, False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Several recipes for sushi rolls from Allrecipes have been found that meet the minimum of 20 reviews. For example, 'Smoked Salmon Sushi Roll' (112 reviews), 'Homemade Sushi' (216 reviews), and 'California Roll Sushi' (79 reviews). Each of these are sushi roll recipes sourced from Allrecipes with over 20 reviews.", 'None of the steps so far have provided Nutrition Facts for any sushi rolls recipe. Only a list of recipe titles and URLs were found, with no nutrition information displayed.', 'The steps taken only show the results of searching for sushi roll recipes, but do not list or show the main ingredients of any located recipe.', 'The steps so far have only listed various sushi roll recipes and their details, but none of the results or explanations provide advice on how to store the prepared sushi rolls, nor does any response specifically offer storage advice for any of the individual recipes found.']

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24228/sushi-roll/'}
Reason: This recipe titled 'Homemade Sushi' has over 20 reviews and matches the user's requirement for a sushi roll recipe from Allrecipes with enough social validation. Fetching its details will provide the main ingredients and nutrition facts data needed, as well as more information to determine storage instructions or tips.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24228/sushi-roll/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Show the Nutrition Facts for the recipe', 'constraints': ['Nutrition Facts must be from the located sushi rolls recipe']}, {'task': 'Show the main ingredients of the recipe', 'constraints': ['Main ingredients must be from the located sushi rolls recipe']}, {'task': 'Tell how to store the prepared sushi rolls', 'constraints': ['Storage advice should apply to the specific sushi roll recipe found']}]
Subtasks Solved: [True, True, False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The nutrition facts for the 'Homemade Sushi' roll recipe have been displayed in the detailed recipe information: Calories: 152, Fat: 4g, Carbs: 26g, Protein: 4g. This information comes directly from the located sushi rolls recipe.", "The agent retrieved the details of the 'Homemade Sushi' recipe, including a list of its main ingredients, which were extracted directly from the located sushi rolls recipe.", "None of the steps provide any information or advice on how to store the prepared sushi rolls from the specific 'Homemade Sushi' recipe. Only preparation, cooking, and serving directions are included. No storage advice is present."]

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'how to store sushi rolls'}
Reason: To fully address the user goal, I need to provide storage instructions for sushi rolls. While I have found a suitable recipe and its nutrition facts and ingredients, the recipe does not include storage information. Searching for how to store sushi rolls will help gather accurate storage instructions.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'how to store sushi rolls'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Tell how to store the prepared sushi rolls', 'constraints': ['Storage advice should apply to the specific sushi roll recipe found']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The customer agent searched for 'how to store sushi rolls' but did not provide advice specific to the Homemade Sushi Roll recipe. No storage instructions were relayed to the user in the steps outlined."]

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19511/smoked-salmon-sushi-roll/'}
Reason: To ensure the user is provided with the most complete answer, I should check the details for an additional highly rated sushi roll recipe ('Smoked Salmon Sushi Roll') found in step 1. This will allow me to verify if storage instructions might be included in a similar sushi roll recipe on Allrecipes, since information in the current recipe ('Homemade Sushi') doesn't explicitly cover storage.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19511/smoked-salmon-sushi-roll/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Tell how to store the prepared sushi rolls', 'constraints': ['Storage advice should apply to the specific sushi roll recipe found']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Although there was a search for 'how to store sushi rolls', none of the steps provided direct storage advice that specifically applies to the Smoked Salmon Sushi Roll recipe. The agent retrieved the recipe details but did not provide or extract any storage instructions for this specific recipe."]
