Executing task: Locate a recipe for vegan chocolate chip cookies with over 60 reviews and a rating of at least 4.5 stars on Allrecipes.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegan chocolate chip cookies'}
Reason: I need to find a list of vegan chocolate chip cookie recipes first, so I can filter for those from Allrecipes with over 60 reviews and a rating of at least 4.5 stars.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegan chocolate chip cookies'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Locate a recipe for vegan chocolate chip cookies on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['Recipe must be vegan', 'Recipe must be for chocolate chip cookies', 'Recipe must be on Allrecipes', 'Recipe must have over 60 reviews', 'Recipe must have a rating of at least 4.5 stars']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["While several vegan chocolate chip cookie recipes from Allrecipes have been located, only one ('Vegan Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal, and Nut Cookies') has over 60 reviews (69) and a rating of 5.0. However, this recipe includes oatmeal and nuts in the name, so it is not strictly a 'vegan chocolate chip cookie' but rather a variation including oatmeal and nuts. All other recipes that are strictly 'vegan chocolate chip cookies' have fewer than 60 reviews. Therefore, none of the located recipes satisfy all specified constraints."]
