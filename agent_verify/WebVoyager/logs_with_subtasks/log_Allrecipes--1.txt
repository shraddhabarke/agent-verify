Executing task: Find a recipe for a vegetarian lasagna that has at least a four-star rating and uses zucchini.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna with zucchini'}
Reason: I need to search for recipes that match the user's requirements: vegetarian lasagna that includes zucchini. This will allow us to identify potential candidates that might have at least a four-star rating.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna with zucchini'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for vegetarian lasagna', 'constraints': ['Recipe must have at least a four-star rating', 'Recipe must use zucchini']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Although multiple vegetarian lasagna options were found, none of the search results clearly indicate a recipe that both uses zucchini and has at least a four-star rating. While 'Debbie's Vegetable Lasagna' has a 4.5-star rating, there is no evidence from the step taken that it contains zucchini. Similarly, other links that might contain zucchini do not have sufficiently high ratings displayed. Therefore, the subtask is not yet solved as neither constraint is fully verified."]

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/236878/debbies-vegetable-lasagna/'}
Reason: Debbie's Vegetable Lasagna appears to be a vegetarian lasagna with a 4.5 star rating. To confirm it contains zucchini as required, I need to get the detailed recipe ingredients.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/236878/debbies-vegetable-lasagna/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for vegetarian lasagna', 'constraints': ['Recipe must have at least a four-star rating', 'Recipe must use zucchini']}]
Subtasks Solved: [True]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The agent found 'Debbie's Vegetable Lasagna' which is vegetarian, includes zucchini as an ingredient, and has a rating of 4.7 (above four stars)."]

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.
