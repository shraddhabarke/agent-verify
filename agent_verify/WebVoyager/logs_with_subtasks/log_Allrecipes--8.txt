Executing task: Search for a recipe for Beef Wellington on Allrecipes that has at least 200 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 stars or higher. List the main ingredients required for the dish.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'Beef Wellington'}
Reason: To satisfy the user's request, I need to search for Beef Wellington recipes on Allrecipes. I will then check the results to find one with at least 200 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 stars or higher.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'Beef Wellington'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Search for a Beef Wellington recipe on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['The recipe must have at least 200 reviews', 'The recipe must have an average rating of 4.5 stars or higher']}, {'task': 'List the main ingredients required for the Beef Wellington dish', 'constraints': ['Ingredients should be based on the selected recipe found on Allrecipes']}]
Subtasks Solved: [True, False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Among the search results is a 'Beef Wellington' recipe on Allrecipes (https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16899/beef-wellington/) with 362 reviews and a 4.5 star average rating, which satisfies both constraints.", 'The steps so far have only performed a search and returned a list of recipes, including a Beef Wellington recipe from Allrecipes, but have not yet listed the main ingredients based on the selected recipe.']

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16899/beef-wellington/'}
Reason: This recipe matches the user's criteria (Beef Wellington, at least 200 reviews, 4.5+ stars). Retrieving recipe details will provide the list of main ingredients.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16899/beef-wellington/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'List the main ingredients required for the Beef Wellington dish', 'constraints': ['Ingredients should be based on the selected recipe found on Allrecipes']}]
Subtasks Solved: [True]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The second step shows a function call to get_recipe_details for the selected 'Beef Wellington' recipe from Allrecipes. The returned result includes a structured list of ingredients, as follows: beef tenderloin, butter, onion, sliced fresh mushrooms, liver pâté, salt and pepper to taste, frozen puff pastry, egg yolk, beef broth, and red wine. This satisfies the subtask and the constraint to use ingredients from the selected Allrecipes recipe."]

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.

Final Result: ['2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin', '4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided', '2 tablespoons butter', '1 onion, chopped', '½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms', '2 ounces liver paté', 'salt and pepper to taste', '1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed', '1 large egg yolk, beaten', '1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth', '2 tablespoons red wine']
