Executing task: Find a recipe for a cauliflower pizza crust that has a preparation time of under 30 minutes and a rating of at least 4 stars on Allrecipes. Include the number of calories per serving.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'cauliflower pizza crust'}
Reason: I need to search for cauliflower pizza crust recipes on Allrecipes to find options that may match the preparation time and rating criteria.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'cauliflower pizza crust'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for a cauliflower pizza crust.', 'constraints': ['Preparation time must be under 30 minutes', 'Recipe must have a rating of at least 4 stars on Allrecipes', 'Include the number of calories per serving']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ['While the search step returns multiple cauliflower pizza crust recipes, none of the steps include details on preparation time or calories per serving, and it is not yet confirmed that the recipe preparation time is under 30 minutes or that the calories per serving are listed. The recipe ratings can be verified from the step, but not the other constraints.']

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232930/cauliflower-pizza-crust/'}
Reason: This recipe ('Cauliflower Pizza Crust') from Allrecipes has a high rating (4.5 from 293 reviews) and matches the title. Retrieving detailed information will let us confirm the preparation time and check the nutrition facts for calories per serving, ensuring it meets all user requirements.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232930/cauliflower-pizza-crust/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for a cauliflower pizza crust.', 'constraints': ['Preparation time must be under 30 minutes', 'Recipe must have a rating of at least 4 stars on Allrecipes', 'Include the number of calories per serving']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The found recipe for cauliflower pizza crust has a preparation time of 15 minutes, which satisfies the prep time constraint. The rating is 4.3, which is above 4 stars, and calorie information is provided (59 calories per serving). However, the total time for the recipe is 1 hour, which might be viewed as exceeding the 'preparation time' constraint if interpreted as the whole process rather than just prep. But since the constraint specifies 'Preparation time' and not 'Total time', and the recipe prep time is 15 minutes, all constraints can be considered satisfied. Therefore, the subtask is solved."]
