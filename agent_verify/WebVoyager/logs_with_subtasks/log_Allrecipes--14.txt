Executing task: Search for a recipe that includes "chicken breast" and "quinoa" with preparation time under 30 minutes on Allrecipes.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa under 30 minutes'}
Reason: To find relevant recipes, I need to search for ones that include both 'chicken breast' and 'quinoa' and have a prep time under 30 minutes. This search query should return matching recipes from Allrecipes for further detail filtering.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa under 30 minutes'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Search for a recipe on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ["Recipe must include 'chicken breast'", "Recipe must include 'quinoa'", 'Preparation time must be under 30 minutes']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Although a search was conducted, none of the results mention a recipe specifically including both 'chicken breast' and 'quinoa', nor do they indicate a preparation time under 30 minutes. The constraints have not been satisfied."]

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa quick recipe'}
Reason: The previous search used a very specific query ('chicken breast quinoa under 30 minutes'), which mostly returned list or gallery articles rather than individual recipes. Trying a broader, but still relevant query ('chicken breast quinoa quick recipe') increases the chance of finding a direct Allrecipes recipe that includes both ingredients and is quick to prepare, which better matches the user's goal.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa quick recipe'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Search for a recipe on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ["Recipe must include 'chicken breast'", "Recipe must include 'quinoa'", 'Preparation time must be under 30 minutes']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["While the agent performed searches on Allrecipes for 'chicken breast quinoa under 30 minutes' and 'chicken breast quinoa quick recipe', and found some related results, none of the listed recipe results explicitly confirm that they both include 'chicken breast' (rather than just 'chicken' as a general term) and 'quinoa', and are prepared in under 30 minutes. For example, 'Instant Pot® Chicken Quinoa Tortilla Soup' could include chicken breast and quinoa, and may be quick, but the information provided does not confirm the specific use of 'chicken breast' or the prep time being under 30 minutes. The subtask, with all its constraints, is therefore not yet definitively solved."]

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261496/instant-pot-chicken-quinoa-tortilla-soup/'}
Reason: The recipe 'Instant Pot® Chicken Quinoa Tortilla Soup' found from Allrecipes fits the ingredient requirements and possibly the prep time requirement (since it's labeled as an 'Instant Pot' and 'quick' recipe). Retrieving detailed info will confirm whether it meets the under-30-minute preparation constraint and includes both 'chicken breast' and 'quinoa' in the ingredients.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261496/instant-pot-chicken-quinoa-tortilla-soup/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Search for a recipe on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ["Recipe must include 'chicken breast'", "Recipe must include 'quinoa'", 'Preparation time must be under 30 minutes']}]
Subtasks Solved: [True]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The steps indicate two searches were performed on Allrecipes with the queries 'chicken breast quinoa under 30 minutes' and 'chicken breast quinoa quick recipe'. Both of these searches satisfy the subtask 'Search for a recipe on Allrecipes'. While the constraints on recipe content and prep time are for the recipe selection, this subtask only requires that a search be done, which has already occurred."]

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/276854/instant-pot-chicken-and-quinoa-soup/'}
Reason: The user's goal asks for a quick recipe with both 'chicken breast' and 'quinoa' and a prep time under 30 minutes. The previously retrieved recipe includes both ingredients and prep time under 30 minutes, but its total time exceeded 30 minutes due to cooking. To thoroughly ensure at least one recipe meets all requirements, it's prudent to check another relevant result—this one may have a shorter total or prep time.
