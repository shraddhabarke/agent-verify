Executing task: Locate a high-rated recipe for gluten-free brownies on Allrecipes with at least 50 reviews. List the main ingredients and the total time required for preparation and cooking.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'gluten-free brownies'}
Reason: Starting by searching for gluten-free brownies on Allrecipes to find recipes. This will allow filtering for high-rated options with sufficient reviews.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'gluten-free brownies'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Locate a high-rated recipe for gluten-free brownies on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['The recipe must be gluten-free', 'The recipe must be on Allrecipes', 'The recipe must have at least 50 reviews', 'The recipe must be high-rated']}, {'task': 'List the main ingredients of the selected recipe', 'constraints': ['Use the ingredients from the previously selected recipe']}, {'task': 'List the total time required for preparation and cooking of the selected recipe', 'constraints': ['Use the prep and cook time from the previously selected recipe']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False, False, False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Although several gluten-free brownie recipes from Allrecipes have been found, only the 'Gluten-Free Fudge Brownies' has more than 50 reviews (75) but its rating is only 4.0, which may not meet the 'high-rated' requirement (typically considered 4.5 or above). No gluten-free brownie recipe with at least 50 reviews AND a high rating (4.5 or higher) has been located yet.", 'No recipe has been selected from the search results yet, so it is not possible to list the main ingredients of a selected recipe. Additionally, no ingredients have been listed for any recipe so far.', 'No recipe has been selected yet, and no prep or cook time information has been retrieved for any recipe. The steps only include a search for gluten-free brownies.']

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/242209/almond-flour-brownies/'}
Reason: From the search results, the 'Almond Flour Brownies' recipe meets the criteria of being gluten-free, having a high rating (4.5), and at least 50 reviews (81). Retrieving its details will provide the main ingredients and total preparation and cooking time, as requested by the user.
