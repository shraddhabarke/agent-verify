Executing task: Find a recipe for a healthy avocado salad on Allrecipes that has a preparation time of less than 20 minutes and more than 30 user reviews. Include the nutritional information per serving.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'healthy avocado salad'}
Reason: The first step is to search for healthy avocado salad recipes on Allrecipes so I can review the list for options that meet the preparation time, review count, and nutrition facts requirements.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'healthy avocado salad'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for a healthy avocado salad on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['Preparation time of less than 20 minutes', 'More than 30 user reviews']}, {'task': 'Include the nutritional information per serving for the recipe', 'constraints': []}]
Subtasks Solved: [False, False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Although several avocado salad recipes were found on Allrecipes, none of them listed in the search results satisfies both constraints: no avocado salad recipe shows a preparation time (so this info is absent), and none of the avocado salad recipes have more than 30 user reviews. For example, 'Kale Salad with Avocado' only has 1 review, and no other recipe with avocado and salad keywords exceeds 30 reviews.", 'The steps taken so far only involve searching for healthy avocado salad recipes and listing results. There is no evidence that nutritional information per serving for the recipe has been provided.']

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/139620/avocado-and-tuna-tapas/'}
Reason: The search results included a recipe titled 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' with 296 ratings, which meets the criterion of having more than 30 user reviews. To check if this recipe has a preparation time of less than 20 minutes and includes nutrition facts per serving, I need to fetch its detailed information next.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/139620/avocado-and-tuna-tapas/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for a healthy avocado salad on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['Preparation time of less than 20 minutes', 'More than 30 user reviews']}, {'task': 'Include the nutritional information per serving for the recipe', 'constraints': []}]
Subtasks Solved: [False, True]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["The 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' recipe from Allrecipes meets the requirements for having more than 30 user reviews (it has 222 reviews) and has a preparation time of 20 minutes. However, the constraint requires the preparation time to be less than 20 minutes, and this recipe's preparation time is exactly 20 minutes, not less. Therefore, the subtask has not been fully satisfied.", "The nutritional information per serving for the 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' recipe is included in the results. Specifically, the nutrition_facts field provides values for Calories (294), Fat (18g), Carbs (11g), and Protein (24g) per serving."]

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230766/winter-green-salad/'}
Reason: While the previously fetched 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' recipe has the required number of reviews and includes avocado, its prep time is listed as '20 mins' which is right at the limit. To ensure a better match, it's beneficial to check other eligible salad recipes from search results such as 'Winter Green Salad', which also has over 30 reviews, to see if it has avocado, meets the prep time requirement, and contains nutrition facts.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230766/winter-green-salad/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for a healthy avocado salad on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['Preparation time of less than 20 minutes', 'More than 30 user reviews']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["Two avocado salad recipes were found and detailed: 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' and 'Winter Green Salad'. While both appear healthy and include avocado, the 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' has more than 30 user reviews (222), but its preparation time is 20 minutes, not less than 20 minutes (constraint is strictly less than 20). The 'Winter Green Salad' has more than 30 reviews but its prep time is 30 minutes. Therefore, neither recipe satisfies both constraints."]

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241982/taco-salad-with-lime-vinegar-dressing/'}
Reason: The two previous recipes checked—Avocado and Tuna Tapas and Winter Green Salad—both had prep times of 20 minutes or more, which does not strictly meet the requirement of 'less than 20 minutes.' Taco Salad with Lime Vinegar Dressing has over 30 reviews, uses avocado (as per its likely content and typical salad type), and may meet the prep time requirement. I will retrieve its details to confirm prep time, review count, avocado, and nutritional facts.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241982/taco-salad-with-lime-vinegar-dressing/'}
Subtasks: [{'task': 'Find a recipe for a healthy avocado salad on Allrecipes', 'constraints': ['Preparation time of less than 20 minutes', 'More than 30 user reviews']}]
Subtasks Solved: [False]
Subtasks Solved Reason: ["None of the retrieved avocado salad recipes satisfy both constraints. The 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' has more than 30 user reviews (296) and is avocado-based, but its preparation time is 20 minutes, not less than 20 minutes. The other salads (e.g., 'Winter Green Salad', 'Taco Salad with Lime Vinegar Dressing') either have preparation times of 30 minutes or do not meet the review threshold."]

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.
