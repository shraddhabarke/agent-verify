Executing task: Find the Easy Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna recipe on Allrecipes and tell me what the latest review says.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'Easy Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: First, we need to search for the specific recipe on Allrecipes to find its URL and retrieve details including the latest review.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'Easy Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna site:allrecipes.com'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: Refine the search query by removing 'Easy' to see if the recipe exists under a slightly different name.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna site:allrecipes.com'}

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'Spinach Lasagna site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: The previous searches did not return results. Trying a broader search query without 'Vegetarian' or 'Easy' might yield the recipe URL needed to get the details and reviews.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'Spinach Lasagna site:allrecipes.com'}

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.

Final Result: The tool did not return any reviews for the Easy Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna recipe.
