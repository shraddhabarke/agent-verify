Executing task: Find a recipe for a healthy avocado salad on Allrecipes that has a preparation time of less than 20 minutes and more than 30 user reviews. Include the nutritional information per serving.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'healthy avocado salad'}
Reason: The user is looking for a specific type of recipe, so the first step is to search for recipes related to 'healthy avocado salad' on Allrecipes.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'healthy avocado salad'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/139620/avocado-and-tuna-tapas/'}
Reason: The recipe 'Avocado and Tuna Tapas' meets the criteria of having more than 30 user reviews and is likely to be related to avocado salad since it includes avocado. The next step is to check if its preparation time is less than 20 minutes and obtain nutritional information per serving.
