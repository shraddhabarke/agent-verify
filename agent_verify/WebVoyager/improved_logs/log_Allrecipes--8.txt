Executing task: Search for a recipe for Beef Wellington on Allrecipes that has at least 200 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 stars or higher. List the main ingredients required for the dish.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'filter_recipes' with args {'recipe_list_str': '[{"title": "Beef Wellington", "url": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16899/beef-wellington/", "rating_count": "362", "rating_value": 4.5}, {"title": "Individual Beef Wellingtons", "url": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15336/individual-beef-wellingtons/", "rating_count": "190", "rating_value": 4.5}]', 'min_rating_str': '4.5', 'min_reviews_str': '200'}
Reason: Combining the recipe filtering, selection, and details retrieval in one step, thus skipping separate get_recipe_details call for initial filtering. The aim is to directly obtain fully detailed recipe(s) matching the reviews and ratings criteria, so we can then extract main ingredients.
