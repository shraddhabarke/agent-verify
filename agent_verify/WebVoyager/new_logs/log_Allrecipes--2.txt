Executing task: Find a recipe for a vegetarian lasagna under 600 calories per serving that has a prep time of less than 1 hour.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna under 600 calories prep time less than 1 hour'}
Reason: Searching for vegetarian lasagna recipes with the specified calorie and prep time constraints is the first step to achieving the userâ€™s goal.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna under 600 calories prep time less than 1 hour'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'quick vegetarian lasagna under 600 calories'}
Reason: The initial search query might have been too specific. Reducing the specificity by removing some constraints, such as 'prep time less than 1 hour,' could yield more results that fit the user's goal.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'quick vegetarian lasagna under 600 calories'}

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'healthy vegetarian lasagna recipe'}
Reason: Previous searches may have been too specific, resulting in no results. A broader query might yield recipes, which can then be filtered for calories and prep time.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'healthy vegetarian lasagna recipe'}

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/236878/debbies-vegetable-lasagna/'}
Reason: The recipe 'Debbie's Vegetable Lasagna' from the previous search has a high rating of 4.5, making it a candidate worth evaluating. I'll retrieve its details to check if it meets the user's criteria (under 600 calories per serving and a prep time of less than 1 hour).
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/236878/debbies-vegetable-lasagna/'}
