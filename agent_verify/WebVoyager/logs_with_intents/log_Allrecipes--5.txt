Executing task: Search for a popular Pasta Sauce with more than 1000 reviews and a rating above 4 stars. Create a shopping list of ingredients for this recipe.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'Pasta Sauce with rating above 4 stars and more than 1000 reviews'}
Reason: We need to search for Pasta Sauce recipes based on the specified criteria, so this function is appropriate to find potential candidates.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'Pasta Sauce with rating above 4 stars and more than 1000 reviews'}
