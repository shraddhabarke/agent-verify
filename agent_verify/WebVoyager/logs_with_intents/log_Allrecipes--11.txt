Executing task: Discover a suitable chocolate cupcake recipe on Allrecipes that has a preparation time of under 1 hour and at least 100 user reviews.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chocolate cupcake prep time under 1 hour site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: To find chocolate cupcake recipes on Allrecipes.com that have a preparation time under 1 hour, and include information about their review count to identify suitable recipes.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chocolate cupcake prep time under 1 hour site:allrecipes.com'}
Result: []

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chocolate cupcake site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: The previous search combining 'prep time under 1 hour' and 'site:allrecipes.com' criteria returned no results. A broader search for 'chocolate cupcake' on Allrecipes without restricting prep time may yield relevant recipes. Once found, I can evaluate preparation time and review count by examining recipe details.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chocolate cupcake site:allrecipes.com'}
Result: [{"type": "text", "text": "{\n  \"title\": \"Tips for Submitting Your Recipe to Allrecipes\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-submit-recipes/\",\n  \"rating_count\": 0,\n  \"rating_value\": 0.0\n}"}]

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.

Final Result: None

Steps taken: 2, Goal Achieved: False
