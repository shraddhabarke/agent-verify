Executing task: Find a recipe with over 100 reviews for Fried Fish on Allrecipes, list the Full Nutrition Label and tell me the amount of Iron per Serving.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'Fried Fish site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: Searching for Fried Fish recipes on Allrecipes to identify options with review counts greater than 100.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'Fried Fish site:allrecipes.com'}
Result: [{"type": "text", "text": "{\n  \"title\": \"Home Cooking Trends of 2020\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/home-cooking-trends-2020/\",\n  \"rating_count\": 0,\n  \"rating_value\": 0.0\n}"}, {"type": "text", "text": "{\n  \"title\": \"Homemade Podcast Episode 30: Cooking With Grandma\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.allrecipes.com/article/homemade-podcast-episode-30-cooking-with-grandma/\",\n  \"rating_count\": 0,\n  \"rating_value\": 0.0\n}"}, {"type": "text", "text": "{\n  \"title\": \"Homemade Podcast Episode 32: Camila Alves McConaughey on Cooking and Community\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.allrecipes.com/article/homemade-podcast-episode-32-camila-alves-mcconaughey/\",\n  \"rating_count\": 0,\n  \"rating_value\": 0.0\n}"}]
