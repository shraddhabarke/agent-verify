Executing task: Find a recipe for a vegetarian lasagna that has over 300 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 or higher on Allrecipes.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna'}
Reason: Starting with a search for 'vegetarian lasagna' recipes to find options that meet the user's criteria of reviews and rating.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna'}
Reason: Reviewing the previous search results, no vegetarian lasagna recipe met the criteria of over 300 reviews with a rating of 4.5 or higher. Thus, executing another search might help in finding additional options.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegetarian lasagna'}

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21090/vegetarian-four-cheese-lasagna/'}
Reason: The search did not return any recipe meeting all the criteria. The 'Vegetarian Four Cheese Lasagna' has the highest rating count but it is just below 300. Let's get the details to see if it fulfills the user's preference otherwise, or to potentially recommend it despite being slightly below the threshold.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21090/vegetarian-four-cheese-lasagna/'}

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.

Final Result: 

Steps taken: 3, Goal Achieved: False
