Executing task: Search for a seafood paella recipe on Allrecipes with a minimum of 4.5 stars rating and at least 50 reviews. The recipe should include shrimp and mussels. Provide the ingredients, total time, and an overview of the preparation steps.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'seafood paella'}
Reason: To find a suitable seafood paella recipe, I will start by searching for seafood paella recipes on Allrecipes to find options that potentially match the user's criteria.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'seafood paella'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/97840/marias-paella/'}
Reason: The recipe 'Maria's Paella' has 64 reviews with a rating of 4.5, meeting the criteria of having at least 50 reviews and a minimum rating of 4.5 stars. We need to check if it includes shrimp and mussels and gather detailed information such as ingredients, total time, and preparation steps.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/97840/marias-paella/'}

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/84137/easy-paella/'}
Reason: I will check another recipe with sufficient ratings (4.5 stars, 621 reviews) to see if it includes both shrimp and mussels.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/84137/easy-paella/'}

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12840/paella-ii/'}
Reason: I will check the details of the 'Paella II' recipe to determine its ingredients and see if it meets the requirement of including shrimp and mussels, with a rating of at least 4.5 stars and 50 reviews.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12840/paella-ii/'}

Step 5: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228444/authentic-seafood-paella/'}
Reason: The first attempt retrieved several recipes but none fully matched the user's criteria of having both shrimp and mussels, and some did not have enough reviews. I will get details for another highly rated recipe to check if it meets all the user's requirements.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228444/authentic-seafood-paella/'}

Step 6: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'seafood paella with shrimp and mussels'}
Reason: Since the previous searches and recipe detail retrievals did not satisfy all criteria, particularly the inclusion of both shrimp and mussels, a new search specifically targeting a seafood paella with shrimp and mussels should be conducted to find an appropriate recipe.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'seafood paella with shrimp and mussels'}

Step 7: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/137464/authentic-paella/'}
Reason: This call is made to verify if the 'Authentic Seafood Paella' recipe includes both shrimp and mussels while checking if it can still meet the user's needs better than previous checks.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/137464/authentic-paella/'}

Step 8: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'seafood paella with shrimp mussels 50 reviews'}
Reason: Previous searches and recipe details found did not meet the criteria of having at least 50 reviews with a 4.5-star or higher rating. The last attempt didn't satisfy the condition of including mussels or having the required number of reviews. Conducting another search with a more precise query may yield the desired results.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'seafood paella with shrimp mussels 50 reviews'}

Step 9: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'seafood paella large number reviews'}
Reason: Previous searches have not returned a recipe that meets the criteria of at least 50 reviews. Let's try a broader search to focus on finding a highly-reviewed seafood paella that includes shrimp and mussels.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'seafood paella large number reviews'}

Step 10: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'seafood paella 4.5 stars 50 reviews with shrimp and mussels'}
Reason: The previous searches and retrieved recipe details did not satisfy the user's criteria of finding a seafood paella recipe that has at least 50 reviews, a minimum of 4.5 stars, and includes shrimp and mussels. A more specific search might yield results that match all the user's specified criteria.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'seafood paella 4.5 stars 50 reviews with shrimp and mussels'}

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.
