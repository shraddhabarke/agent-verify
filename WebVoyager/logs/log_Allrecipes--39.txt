Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'sushi rolls'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19511/smoked-salmon-sushi-roll/'}

Reason: The details for one recipe have been retrieved, but no storage instructions were provided. To find potential storage instructions and gather information on another highly rated recipe, we should fetch details for the 'Homemade Sushi' recipe, which also matches the user's criteria.

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/169856/cream-cheese-and-crab-sushi-rolls/'}
Reason: We already have the details for two recipes with enough reviews, but checking one more recipe will ensure more options if one of them meets storage preference better or contains additional unattended factors.

Step 8: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/99211/perfect-sushi-rice/'}
Reason: Since all previously fetched recipes include detailed instructions, nutrition facts, and ingredients, we have multiple options fitting the criteria.
