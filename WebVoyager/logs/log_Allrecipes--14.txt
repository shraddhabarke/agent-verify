Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa prep time under 30 minutes'}
Reason: The user wants a recipe that includes chicken breast and quinoa and has a preparation time under 30 minutes. The first step is to search for relevant recipes based on this criteria.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa prep time under 30 minutes'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa recipe'}
Reason: Refining the search query to focus on recipes specifically, as the first search returned an article not a recipe. Removing the time constraint to find any relevant recipes first.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa recipe'}

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/air-fryer-pesto-chicken-quinoa-bowl-recipe-11691482'}
Reason: The next step is to get the preparation time for the recipe titled 'Air Fryer Pesto Chicken Quinoa Bowl' to check if it meets the under 30 minutes requirement.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/air-fryer-pesto-chicken-quinoa-bowl-recipe-11691482'}

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/215076/chicken-with-quinoa-and-veggies/'}
Reason: The user is looking for a recipe with chicken breast and quinoa that has a preparation time under 30 minutes. We have already retrieved details for one such recipe, but checking another option will ensure we provide alternatives, especially if this recipe has a suitable prep time.

Step 5: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245332/quinoa-with-butternut-squash-chicken-and-goat-cheese/'}
Reason: I need to check the preparation time for 'Quinoa with Butternut Squash, Chicken, and Goat Cheese' to see if it meets the user's requirement of under 30 minutes. Although this recipe appeared in the search results, I need its details to verify if the preparation time aligns with the user's goal.

Step 6: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/276854/instant-pot-chicken-and-quinoa-soup/'}
Reason: So far, the previous recipe searches and details provided recipes with preparation times under 30 minutes. However, since the user is searching for more options, checking another recipe with 'chicken breast' and 'quinoa' could reveal more possible candidates that fit the time constraint.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/276854/instant-pot-chicken-and-quinoa-soup/'}

Step 7: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa recipe quick'}
Reason: While several recipes were found in the previous search, many did not meet the criteria of a prep time under 30 minutes. Searching with the keyword 'quick' may help identify recipes with shorter preparation durations.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa recipe quick'}

Step 8: LLM suggests calling 'get_recipe_details' with args {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261496/instant-pot-chicken-quinoa-tortilla-soup/'}
Reason: Reviewing the details for 'Instant PotÂ® Chicken Quinoa Tortilla Soup' to check if its preparation time fits within the user's criteria. Previous searches for quick recipes included this one, but details were not yet retrieved.
Function Name: get_recipe_details Function Args: {'recipe_url': 'https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261496/instant-pot-chicken-quinoa-tortilla-soup/'}

Step 9: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa under 30 minutes'}
Reason: The previous searches and recipe details retrieved didn't satisfy the user's criteria of 'prep time under 30 minutes', or the recipes retrieved with quick preparation didn't match user interest. Trying a new search with a slightly altered query to better fit the user's requirement for quick chicken and quinoa recipes.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'chicken breast quinoa under 30 minutes'}
