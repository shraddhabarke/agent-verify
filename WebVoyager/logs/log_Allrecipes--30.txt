Executing task: Find a recipe for a vegan smoothie bowl on Allrecipes that includes bananas and leaves, has more than 20 reviews, and a rating of at least 4 stars. Provide a list of ingredients, preparation time, and a summary of the recipe steps.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl banana leaves'}
Reason: I will search for vegan smoothie bowl recipes that include bananas and leaves on Allrecipes.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl banana leaves'}

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegan banana smoothie bowl'}
Reason: The initial search query did not yield relevant results, possibly due to specificity. Searching with 'vegan banana smoothie bowl' might find more relevant recipes that fit the user's requirements.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegan banana smoothie bowl'}

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl banana spinach recipe'}
Reason: We are refining the search by specifying 'spinach' instead of 'leaves', a common green used in smoothies, and by including 'recipe' to find a specific smoothie bowl recipe rather than general articles or compilations.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl banana spinach recipe'}

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl banana spinach'}
Reason: We need to refine our search to find specific recipes that might include ingredients like banana and spinach (as a type of leaf), as previous searches were returning irrelevant articles or collections. This search might yield individual recipe results rather than gallery-type responses.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl banana spinach'}

Step 5: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl with banana and spinach'}
Reason: The previous search attempts did not yield recipes with reviews and ratings. Adjusting the query to 'vegan smoothie bowl with banana and spinach' might help find more relevant results with available ratings and reviews.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'vegan smoothie bowl with banana and spinach'}

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.
