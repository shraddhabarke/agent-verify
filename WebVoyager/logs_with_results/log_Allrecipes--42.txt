Executing task: Find a recipe for banana bread with more than 200 reviews and a rating of at least 4.0 stars on Allrecipes.

Step 1: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'banana bread site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: Searching for banana bread recipes on Allrecipes to find options that may meet the user's requirements for reviews and rating.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'banana bread site:allrecipes.com'}
Result: [{"type": "text", "text": "{\n  \"title\": \"Meet MyRecipes: The Easiest Way to Keep Track of All Your Favorite Recipes (Including Ours!)\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.allrecipes.com/meet-myrecipes-11685062\",\n  \"rating_count\": 0,\n  \"rating_value\": 0.0\n}"}]

Step 2: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'banana bread recipe site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: The previous search did not yield any relevant recipe results. Adjusting the query to focus directly on banana bread recipes from Allrecipes may provide better results.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'banana bread recipe site:allrecipes.com'}
Result: [{"type": "text", "text": "{\n  \"title\": \"Meet MyRecipes: The Easiest Way to Keep Track of All Your Favorite Recipes (Including Ours!)\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.allrecipes.com/meet-myrecipes-11685062\",\n  \"rating_count\": 0,\n  \"rating_value\": 0.0\n}"}]

Step 3: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'best banana bread site:allrecipes.com rating>4 reviews>200'}
Reason: Refine the search query to specifically filter banana bread recipes on Allrecipes with a rating above 4.0 and more than 200 reviews since the previous attempts returned unrelated results.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'best banana bread site:allrecipes.com rating>4 reviews>200'}
Result: []

Step 4: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'banana bread recipe with at least 4 stars and 200 reviews site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: Previous searches did not return relevant results, so a modified query is necessary to potentially find recipes that meet the rating and review criteria.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'banana bread recipe with at least 4 stars and 200 reviews site:allrecipes.com'}
Result: []

Step 5: LLM suggests calling 'search' with args {'query': 'banana bread with high reviews and ratings site:allrecipes.com'}
Reason: Trying a simpler search query to find a banana bread recipe with high ratings and reviews from Allrecipes, as prior searches were either too specific or did not yield results.
Function Name: search Function Args: {'query': 'banana bread with high reviews and ratings site:allrecipes.com'}
Result: []

Task complete or LLM indicated to stop.

Final Result: []

Steps taken: 5, Goal Achieved: False
