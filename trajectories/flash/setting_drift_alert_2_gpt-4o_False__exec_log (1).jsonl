Incident description: [SettingDrift] enablepubsubauburnthrowingforsubscriberapi is drifted. \n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nExecutor: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nIncidentAgent: An agent capable of querying incident descriptions, but not providing any additional troubleshooting information beyond the description itself.\nKustoAgent: An agent that can run the kusto query\nGeneralAssistant: An AI-powered assistant that can handle a variety of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, summarization, text editing, content enhancement, and general assistance based on a given task description.\n\n\n\nHere is a fact sheet to consider:\n\n\n1. Avoid asking the Kusto query agent to generate a query unless a predefined Kusto query already exists in the plan. It will always fail.\n2. If no suitable agent can be assigned to a step, you may assign the user proxy agent as a last resort. However, this should be avoided whenever possible.\n3. If you request information from the user, ensure your response includes sufficient context. For example, when asking the user to run a command, specify the exact command in the user query along with the expected output. \n\n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nStep-1: Identify Drifted Setting Name from Incident Title - next steps: [['Step-2']]\n### Step 1: Find the Setting Name From the Incident Title\n\nThe drifted setting name is listed in the incident title, such as \"EnableMerlinLiveMigration\" in the incident \"Incident\n422175260 : [SettingDrift] EnableMerlinLiveMigration is drifted\".\n\n\nStep-2: Locate Clusters with Drifted Setting - next steps: [['Step-3', 'FINAL_ANSWER']]\n### Step 2: Find Clusters With Drifted Setting\n\nAfter receiving this alert, the first step is to find out which clusters have the incorrect (or different) setting value\nrelative to the gold setting value. This can be achieved by the following query (note that the driftedSettingName must\nbe replaced with the actual setting name):\n\n```kusto\nlet driftedSettingName = 'EnableMerlinLiveMigration';\ncluster('azurecm').database('AzureCM').NetworkServiceManagerEvents\n| where PreciseTimeStamp > ago(6h)\n| where TaskName == 'ChangedSetting' and Message has driftedSettingName\n| parse Message with 'name=\"' SettingName '\" value=\"' SettingValue '\" buildVersion=\"' BuildVersion '\"'\n| project nsmTime = PreciseTimeStamp, SettingName, ActualValue = SettingValue, BuildVersion, Tenant, Region\n| summarize arg_max(nsmTime, *) by Region, Tenant, SettingName\n| extend _key = tolower(Tenant)\n| join kind = leftouter (\ncluster('aznwsdn').database('aznwmds').NSMGoalState\n| where DataIngestionTime > ago(1d)\n| where not(InFlight)\n| where SettingName =~ driftedSettingName\n| summarize arg_max(DataIngestionTime, *) by ClusterName\n| project ClusterName, SettingName, ExpectedValue = SettingValue, _key = tolower(ClusterName)\n) on _key\n| where ClusterName != \"\"\n| where ActualValue !~ ExpectedValue\n| project Region, ClusterName, ExpectedValue\n```\n\nThe typical output is the following table (actual output may be different):\n\n| Region | ClusterName   | ExpectedValue |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|\n| uswest | BY1PrdSdf01   | TRUE          |\n| ...    | ...           | ...           |\n| useast | BLZ21PrdStr26 | TRUE          |\n\nIf the Kusto query execution returns an empty result, directly conclude that it is a false alarm and proceed with generating the final answer.\n\n\nStep-3: Remove Stage and Canary Regions - next steps: [['Step-4']]\n### Step 3: Filter Out Stage and Canary Regions\n\nThe following regions are stage and canary which typically do not have customer impact if settings are drifted, and\nsometimes those clusters in the regions are used for testing. So we can filter them out from the result in Step 2:\n\n| Category | Region Name   |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Stage    | usstagesc     |\n| Stage    | usstagee      |\n| Canary   | useast2euap   |\n| Canary   | uscentraleuap |\n\nIf the output remains empty after filtering, it indicates a false alarm. Move to final answer step.\n\n\nStep-4: Verify Cluster Traffic - next steps: [['Step-5']]\n### Step 4: Check If a Cluster Has Live Traffic\n\nGoal setting values are applied during the cluster buildout. Before a cluster is released, the settings are expected to\nbe drifted. The following query is to count the number of tenants (or _Allocation Unit_) persisted in NSM IMOS\nrepository. If the result is 0, there is no tenant and we can ignore the alert for the cluster in question (note the\nclusterName must be replaced with the actual cluster names in the previous step output):\n\n```kusto\nlet clusterName = 'BY1PrdApp28';\ncluster('azurecm').database('AzureCM').LogTenantNetworkInfoSnapshot\n| where PreciseTimeStamp > ago(1d) and Tenant == clusterName\n| summarize dcount(serviceId)\n```\n\nAt this final step, we should have a list of clusters with the drifted settings.\n\n\nStep-5: Decide on Mitigation Actions - next steps: [['FINAL_ANSWER']]\n## Mitigation\n\nIf the number of cluster is 0, the incident is a false alarm. The DRI is expected to paste the TSG output in the\nincident discussion following the investigation steps, and mark the incident as false alarm.\n\nIf the number of clusters is equal to or less than 5, the DRI can run the \"SetNmSetting\" OaaS job to mitigate the\nincident. The list of cluster names (output in Step 3) can be entered in `mitigationTargets.json` which will be used to\nlaunch OaaS job:\n\n```json\n[\n{ \"TargetType\": \"Cluster\", \"TargetId\": [ \"BY1PrdApp28\" ] },\n{ \"TargetType\": \"Cluster\", \"TargetId\": [ \"BLZ21PrdStr26\" ] }\n]\n```\n\nThe setting name and gold value (output in Step 1) have to be entered in `overrideParam.json` as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n\"name\": \"PubSubServiceEnableReliableTaskCreation\",\n\"value\": \"false\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that the actual cluster names and setting name and value must be copied from the investigation result.\n\nIf the number of clusters is greater than 5, the DRI should do the following:\n\n- Paste the TSG output in the incident discussion.\n\n- Consult with their manager or the feature owner to investigate why the setting in many clusters are drifted. Then\nconsider using config push deployment job to mitigate the issue.\n\n\nFINAL_ANSWER: Final Answer - next steps: [['DONE']]\nThe final step to generate final answer.\n\n\n\n",

If the result is 0, there is no tenant and we can ignore the alert for the cluster in question (note the\nclusterName must be replaced with the actual cluster names in the previous step output):\n\n```kusto\nlet clusterName = 'BY1PrdApp28';\ncluster('azurecm').database('AzureCM').LogTenantNetworkInfoSnapshot\n| where PreciseTimeStamp > ago(1d) and Tenant == clusterName\n| summarize dcount(serviceId)\n```\n\nAt this final step, we should have a list of clusters with the drifted settings.\n\n\nStep-5: Decide on Mitigation Actions - next steps: [['FINAL_ANSWER']]\n## Mitigation\n\nIf the number of cluster is 0, the incident is a false alarm. The DRI is expected to paste the TSG output in the\nincident discussion following the investigation steps, and mark the incident as false alarm.\n\nIf the number of clusters is equal to or less than 5, the DRI can run the \"SetNmSetting\" OaaS job to mitigate the\nincident. The list of cluster names (output in Step 3) can be entered in `mitigationTargets.json` which will be used to\nlaunch OaaS job:\n\n```json\n[\n{ \"TargetType\": \"Cluster\", \"TargetId\": [ \"BY1PrdApp28\" ] },\n{ \"TargetType\": \"Cluster\", \"TargetId\": [ \"BLZ21PrdStr26\" ] }\n]\n```\n\nThe setting name and gold value (output in Step 1) have to be entered in `overrideParam.json` as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n\"name\": \"PubSubServiceEnableReliableTaskCreation\",\n\"value\": \"false\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that the actual cluster names and setting name and value must be copied from the investigation result.\n\nIf the number of clusters is greater than 5, the DRI should do the following:\n\n- Paste the TSG output in the incident discussion.\n\n- Consult with their manager or the feature owner to investigate why the setting in many clusters are drifted. Then\nconsider using config push deployment job to mitigate the issue.\n\n\nFINAL_ANSWER: Final Answer - next steps: [['DONE']]\nThe final step to generate final answer.\n\n\n\n",
